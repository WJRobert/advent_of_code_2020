# Advent of Code 2020 Puzzle Solver
## Overview
This project is a personal project for me to track and save my Advent of Code puzzle solving code.

## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an awesome set of small programming puzzles that you tackle day for day in December each year.   
To read more about it please go the [Advent of Code' about page](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) and the creator's personal [website](http://was.tl/)

## Technical Overview
This year I decided to tackle it using Java as I am very familiar with it and want to win my wife in the leaderboards.

This project makes use of Gradle to handle dependencies and build the project.
To build this project simple run `gradle build` in your command line/terminal.

All puzzle solver classes are used to calculate and solve the puzzles.
The test classes for these are used to solve the custom inputs I receive for my account on Advent of Code.
